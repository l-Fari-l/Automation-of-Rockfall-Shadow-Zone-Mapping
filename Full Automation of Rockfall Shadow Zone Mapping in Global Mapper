// Anything written after "//" is a comment and will not be processed. In addition, you will notice that there is a "\" at the end of few lines this means that the code is continuing in the next line.
// In Global Mapper Script there is usally a COMMAND GIVEN which is followed by parameters. When stating the value of parameter is is important put the value in quotation.
// IMPORT_DIR_TREE is a command that allows you to import files into global mapper from a certain directory. DIRECTORY is a paramater. Hence, change the directory to the folder where your files are located for the DIRECTORY parameter.

// THe following code of line runs a command to carry out raster recalssificaiton on the DEM file. Please enter the DEM file name in the filename section. In addition, this command requires you to set the rules using a gmr file. The rules are basically how do you want to carry out the raster reclassification. For this code, this file has been created and will be shared with the code. To know the details of what rules have been set, you can open the gmr file using note pad and see the rules. In case anyone wants to change the rules, you could either create one by scratch by going to global mapper then go to raster reclassification tool and then setting the rules that you want and save the rules as a gmr file or you can open global mapper then go to raster reclassification tool and then load the already created gmr file and edit it as needed (This is also another way to see what rules have beeen already defined in the gmr file for this code/script).

So we are using the counter variable in the filename parameter which will go from 0 to 360 to run the viewshed analysis on the layers created based on the SDN number. In addition, we also defined an additional variable named STart Angle which will have the value of the Arrtibute named start angle for each layer and all points in each layer will have the same start angle since each layer was created based on the SDN values (meaning all points which have same SDN value are in one layer snd hecne have same start angle as well). In short, gonna go layer by layer (from 0 to 360) and carry out view shed analysis for all points for each layer
