//INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THIS. LOAD YOUR ORTHOPHOTO AND DEM FILE ONTO GLOBAL MAPPER. SELECT THE CREATE
//POINT/TEXT FEATURE AND CREATE ONE POINT FEATURE AT THE POINT OF INTEREST. WHEN CREATING THE FIRST POINT FEATURE A
//POP-UP BOX WILL APPEAR WHERE YOU HAVE TO NAME THE LAYER AS “THE CHOSEN ONES”, SPECIFY THE STYLE OF THE POINT AS
//YOU WANT (E.G, ORANGE DOT) AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, TICK THE BOX NEAR “AUTOMATICALLY APPLY THESE SETTINGS TO NEW
//FEATURES OF THE SAME TYPE” THIS WILL SAVE THE SETTINGS FOR THIS LAYER AND WILL ALLOW YOU TO CREATE MULTIPLE POINT
//FEATURES AT MULTIPLE POINT OF INTERESTS EASILY WITHOUT THE POP-UP BOX POPPING UP.
// Use the orthophoto or (DEM RECLASSIFIED if generated from the code in APPENDIX B) to identify the point of interests
// Calculating elevation and slope values at all the points that were created.

// Copying the slope direction values created from previous command to a new attribute named as SDN which stands for “Slope Direction Numerical”. Important
//to note that for this DEM when slope stats are calculated the slope direction attribute is named as SLOPE_DIR and this might differ for another DEM hence you
//may face an error for this and may have to edit the "SLOPE_DIR" in the “ATTR_TO_COPY” parameter.

// “CALC_ATTR_FORMULA” command allows carrying out calculation on attributes. In this case I am creating a new attribute called "Start Angle" (which is
//going to be used as an input for the viewshed analysis) using the SDN attribute. I want the start angle of the viewshed analysis to be less than 30 degrees than the
//slope direction at the point feature. If you do not wish to use 30 then simply just replace 30 with number you want in the “FORMULA” parameter.

// Running a loop using a variable loop. %Counter% is a predefined variable that counts which loop step is ongoing and we are using it to run the view shed analysis
//on the layers created in the previous command. All the layers created are based on the SDN values which are basically numbers. So, we are using the counter
//variable in the filename parameter which will go from 0 to 360 to run the viewshed analysis on the layers created based on the SDN number. In addition, we also
//defined an additional variable named Start Angle which will have the value of the attribute named start angle for each layer and all points in each layer will have
//the same start angle since each layer was created based on the SDN values (meaning all points which have same SDN value are in one layer and hence have same
//start angle as well). In short, going to go layer by layer (from 0 to 360) and carry out view shed analysis for all points for each layer
