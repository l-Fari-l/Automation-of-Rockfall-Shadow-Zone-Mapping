<h1 align="center">Automation-of-Rockfall-Shadow-Zone-Mapping</h1>

This is still a work in progress. I will be updating the instructions and comments for this tool, hopefully by the end of June 2023.

See the google drive link for a one page report about the tools developed and their results produced. Please note that its just a rough draft and I will be making a proper report soon and sharing it as well (e.g., improve maps by reducing clutter). In addition, I have given commenter access to the google drive link, so that anyone can give feedback or comment on the report (e.g., If something is not clear or if I can improve anything or you).

If you have any suggestions, questions or problems, do let me know!
