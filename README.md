I will be improving the instructions (e.g. spelling mistakes) for this tool as I get time.

Please read the "Tool or Script Summary" PDF before using. Do not copy the code from the PDF as I will be updating things in the notepad files first.

It is recommended to use the semi-automation script due to the limitations stated in the "Tool or Script Summary" PDF for full automation. 

The full automation script requires an additional file which I have not uploaded yet but it is a file which you can create yourself and the method to do so is explained in "Tool or Script Summary" PDF in the script comments.

I will be uploading a Rockfall Hazard and Assessment and Mitigation for Highway 3 and Eagle RV Park & Campground in Keremeos soon. It is currently under review.

If you have any suggestions, questions or problems, do let me know!
