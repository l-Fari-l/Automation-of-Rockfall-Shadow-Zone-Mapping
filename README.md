I will be improving the instructions for this tool as I get time.

Please read the "Tool or Script Summary Rough Draft" PDF before using it. Do not copy the code from the PDF as I will be updating things in the notepad files first.In addition, I changed the orientation of the pages from  landscape to portrait which has caused the lines of the code to shift; I will be fixing that as a I get time. Hence, use the notepad files to take the code. 

It is recommended to use the semi-automation script due to the limitations stated in the "Tool or Script Summary Rough Draft" PDF for full automation. The result of the semi-automation script is shown below.

The full automation script requires an additional file which I have not uploaded yet but it is a file that you can create yourself and the method to do so is explained in the "Tool or Script Summary Rough Draft" PDF in the script comments.

I will be uploading a Rockfall Hazard and Assessment Report of Highway 3 and Eagle RV Park & Campground in Keremeos soon. It is currently under review.

If you have any suggestions, questions, or problems, do let me know!
